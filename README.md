This is a prototype of a simple puzzle game.

## Building
Will probably build with a version of Visual Studio around 2009. The prototype
uses MFC which might make it harder to build on recent versions of Visual Studio
since MFC is no longer installed with it by default.

## History
Conception: January 2009

Around 2009 when it seemed like everyone was becoming millionaires with iPhone
apps I had this idea to create a simple but fun puzzle game. My friend Scott
Hanks came up with a simple design, made the graphics and music for it, and I
programmed the prototype, then I lost interest in the project and that is what
is here today. I think it might still be a game worth making since it might be
fun.
