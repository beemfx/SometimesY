This is a prototype of a simple puzzle game.

## Building
I have not built the current source with the VS 2022 project since it requires
MFC to be installed. That isn't to say it won't build, but I'm not sure.

## History
Conception: January 2009

Around 2009 when it seemed like everyone was becoming millionaires with iPhone
apps I had this idea to create a simple but fun puzzle game. My friend Scott
Hanks came up with a simple design, made the graphics and music for it, and I
programmed the prototype, then I lost interest in the project and that is what
is here today. I think it might still be a game worth making since it might be
fun.
